# Brave Bot

An autonomous coding agent for Brave projects. Built on Claude Code, it reads Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), implements user stories, runs tests, creates PRs, handles review feedback, and manages CI — all autonomously in iterative loops.

Each clone of this repo targets a single project (configured via `config.json`). To use with multiple repositories, clone once per project with its own config.

## Overview

The bot operates in an iterative loop with a state machine workflow:

1. Reads PRD from `data/prd.json`
2. Picks the next story using smart priority (reviewers first!):
   - **URGENT**: Pushed PRs where reviewer responded (respond immediately)
   - **HIGH**: Pushed PRs where bot responded (check for new reviews/merge)
   - **MEDIUM**: Committed PRs (create PR)
   - **NORMAL**: Start new development work
3. Executes based on current status:
   - **pending**: Implement, test, and commit → `committed`
   - **committed**: Push branch and create PR → `pushed` (lastActivityBy: "bot")
   - **pushed**: Check merge readiness FIRST, then:
     - If mergeable: Merge → `merged`
     - If reviewer commented: Implement feedback, push → (lastActivityBy: "bot")
     - If waiting: Skip to next story (will check again next iteration)
   - **merged**: Post-merge monitoring (CI breakage, flakes)
4. Updates progress in `data/progress.txt`
5. Repeats until all stories have terminal status (`merged`, `skipped`, or `invalid`)

**Story Lifecycle:**
```
     pending
        ↓
    (implement + test)
        ↓
    committed
        ↓
    (push + create PR)
        ↓
     pushed ◄─────────┐
    ╱   │   ╲         │
   ╱    │    ╲        │
merge  wait  review   │
  │     │     ↓       │
  │     │   (implement + test)
  │     │     ↓       │
  │     │   (commit + push)
  │     │     └───────┘
  ↓     │
merged  └─► (check again next iteration)
  ↓
(post-merge monitoring)
```

**Key Points:**
- Initial development: pending → (implement+test) → committed
- Review response: pushed → (implement+test) → (commit+push) → pushed
- **Same quality gates apply** — ALL tests must pass whether initial development or responding to reviews

**Anti-Stuck Guarantee:** Every `pushed` PR is checked for merge readiness on EVERY iteration, even when `lastActivityBy: "bot"`. Approved PRs never get stuck.

**Smart Waiting:** The bot tracks `lastActivityBy` to avoid spamming PRs while ensuring progress. See [docs/workflow-state-machine.md](docs/workflow-state-machine.md) for detailed flow.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** installed and configured
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) authenticated with your account
- **jq** for JSON parsing: `brew install jq` (macOS) or `sudo apt install jq` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- **flock** for run locking: `brew install flock` (macOS — included by default on Linux)
- **Git** configured with your credentials
- **Python 3** (for utility scripts)
- **signal-cli** (optional) — for Signal message notifications. See [Signal Notifications](#signal-notifications-optional) below
- Access to the target GitHub repositories

## Setup

### 1. Clone This Repository

Clone alongside (or near) your target project's repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brave-experiments/brave-core-bot.git my-project-bot
cd my-project-bot
```

### 2. Run Setup (creates config.json interactively)

```bash
make setup
```

This will prompt you for:
- Project name, GitHub org, PR and issue repositories
- Bot username and email
- Issue labels for backlog sync

It also initializes submodules and installs pre-commit hooks.

### 3. Configure Git

Configure git identity in the target repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/target/repo
git config user.name "your-bot-name"
git config user.email "your-bot@example.com"
```

These settings are repository-specific (stored in `.git/config`), not global.

### 4. Create PRD

Copy the example template and customize:

```bash
cd my-project-bot

cp data/prd.example.json data/prd.json
cp data/run-state.example.json data/run-state.json
cp data/progress.example.txt data/progress.txt
```

Edit `data/prd.json` to set your working directory path (e.g., `src/brave`).

These files contain user-specific paths and runtime state, so they're gitignored.

### 5. Create Your PRD

**Option A: Use the `/prd` skill** (recommended)
```bash
claude
> /prd [describe your feature]
```
Follow the prompts, then use `/prd-json` to convert to `data/prd.json`.

**Option B: Manually edit `data/prd.json`**

```json
{
  "config": {
    "workingDirectory": "src/brave"
  },
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "STORY-1",
      "title": "Fix authentication test",
      "priority": 1,
      "status": "pending",
      "branchName": null,
      "prNumber": null,
      "prUrl": null,
      "lastActivityBy": null,
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "npm run test -- auth_tests from src/brave"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status values:** `"pending"` | `"committed"` | `"pushed"` | `"merged"` | `"skipped"` | `"invalid"`

**lastActivityBy values:** `null` (fresh) | `"bot"` (waiting for reviewer) | `"reviewer"` (bot should act)

## Usage

### Run the Bot

`run.sh` can be run from any directory — it resolves all paths from its own location:

```bash
./run.sh              # Default: 10 iterations
./run.sh 20           # Run 20 iterations
./run.sh 10 tui       # TUI mode (interactive terminal UI)
```

Skills (like `/review-prs`) are run interactively from the bot directory:

```bash
claude
> /review-prs 1d open
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
tail -f data/progress.txt
```

### Stop the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C`. The bot will attempt to switch back to the master branch before exiting.

### Reset Between Runs

```bash
./scripts/reset-run-state.sh
```

Resets `data/run-state.json` for a fresh run while preserving configuration flags.

## Skills

Bot-only skills are available as slash commands in Claude Code. 8 bot-specific skills are included:

### PRD & Project Management

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/prd` | Generate structured PRDs with clarifying questions |
| `/prd-json` | Convert PRD markdown to `prd.json` format |
| `/prd-clean` | Archive merged/invalid stories to `prd.archived.json` |
| `/add-backlog-to-prd` | Fetch open issues from brave/brave-browser by label and add to PRD |

### Code Review & Quality

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/review-prs` | Batch review PRs for best practices violations. Supports auto mode for cron. Deduplicates against existing bot comments. Tracks prior comment context |
| `/learnable-pattern-search` | Analyze PR review comments to discover learnable patterns. Supports self-review mode to identify overly strict rules |
| `/update-best-practices` | Fetch and merge upstream Chromium documentation guidelines |

### Monitoring

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/check-signal` | Check incoming Signal messages and execute commands |

### Developer Skills (brave-core-tools)

14 additional developer-facing skills (commit, pr, review, preflight, etc.) are maintained in [brave-core-tools](https://github.com/brave-experiments/brave-core-tools). See that repo's README for the full list. These are included here as a git submodule for best-practices access but are not used by the bot directly.

## Run State Configuration

`data/run-state.json` controls per-run behavior:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `runId` | Timestamp when this run started (auto-set) |
| `storiesCheckedThisRun` | Story IDs already processed in this run |
| `skipPushedTasks` | Skip all "pushed" PRs, only work on new development |
| `enableMergeBackoff` | Enable post-merge monitoring (default: true) |
| `mergeBackoffStoryIds` | Array of specific merged story IDs to check, or null for all |
| `lastIterationHadStateChange` | Tracks if work was done last iteration |

## Configuration Files

### data/prd.json

Product Requirements Document defining user stories and acceptance criteria.

- `config.workingDirectory`: Git repository path (typically `src/brave`)
- `userStories[].id`: Unique story identifier
- `userStories[].priority`: Execution order (1 = highest)
- `userStories[].status`: Story state
- `userStories[].branchName`: Git branch name (set when work starts)
- `userStories[].prNumber`: PR number (set when PR created)
- `userStories[].prUrl`: PR URL (set when PR created)
- `userStories[].lastActivityBy`: Who acted last — `"bot"` | `"reviewer"` | `null`
- `userStories[].acceptanceCriteria`: Test commands that must pass

### data/progress.txt

Log of completed iterations:
- Codebase Patterns section (reusable patterns discovered during development)
- Per-iteration entries with status transitions, files changed, test results
- Learnings for future iterations

### .claude/CLAUDE.md

Agent instructions defining workflow, testing requirements, git operations, security guidelines, and quality standards.

## Best Practices

The bot enforces a comprehensive set of best practices organized by category:

- **Architecture** — Layering, dependency injection, factory patterns
- **Coding Standards** — Naming, CHECK vs DCHECK, IWYU, ownership, WeakPtr, base utilities
- **Testing** — Async patterns, JavaScript tests, navigation, test isolation
- **Frontend** — TypeScript/React, XSS prevention, component patterns
- **Build System** — BUILD.gn, buildflags, DEPS, GRD resources
- **Chromium src/ Overrides** — Override patterns, minimizing duplication
- **Documentation** — Inline comments, method docs

See [BEST-PRACTICES.md](brave-core-tools/BEST-PRACTICES.md) for the full index and quick checklist (available via the brave-core-tools submodule).

## Git Workflow

### Branch Management

Each user story gets its own branch, created automatically by the bot from `data/prd.json`.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Two hooks are installed by `make setup`:

**Target repo hook** (`hooks/pre-commit`):
Blocks the configured bot account from modifying dependency files (package.json, DEPS, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.). Prevents bots from introducing external dependencies without review.

**Bot repo hook** (`hooks/pre-commit-bot-repo`):
Blocks committing `data/prd.json`, `data/progress.txt`, and `data/run-state.json` to ensure user-specific files don't get committed.

### Commit Format

```
feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]
```

Commits must NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines.

## Testing

### Acceptance Criteria

All acceptance criteria tests MUST run and pass before marking a story as complete. The bot will:
- Run ALL tests specified in acceptance criteria
- Use background execution for long-running tests
- Never skip tests regardless of duration
- Only mark a story complete when tests actually pass

### Test Suite

Run the automated test suite to verify setup:

```bash
./tests/test-suite.sh
```

Validates GitHub API integration, file structure, filtering scripts, pre-commit hooks, and configuration files.

## Security

### Prompt Injection Protection

The bot filters all GitHub data (issues, PR reviews) through security scripts that check authors against Brave org membership:

```bash
./scripts/filter-issue-json.sh 12345 markdown   # Filtered issue content
./scripts/filter-pr-reviews.sh 12345             # Filtered PR reviews
```

External user content is marked as `[filtered]` to prevent prompt injection attacks.

### Org Member Cache

Org membership is cached in `.ignore/org-members.txt` (survives reboots, unlike /tmp). The cache is required for `run.sh` to start — regenerate with `make setup` if missing.

### Trusted Reviewers Allowlist

When running with an external GitHub account that can't see private org membership:

```bash
cd scripts
cp trusted-reviewers.txt.example trusted-reviewers.txt
# Add one trusted username per line
```

### Other Security Measures

- **Dependency restrictions**: Pre-commit hook prevents bot from updating dependencies
- **Bot permissions**: Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous operation
- **Review differentiation**: Review skill rejects fixes that aren't materially different from previous failed attempts

See [SECURITY.md](brave-core-tools/SECURITY.md) for complete guidelines.

## Signal Notifications (Optional)

The bot can send real-time notifications via Signal when key events happen (PR created, review comments posted, CI retriggered, etc.). This is entirely optional — everything works without it.

### Install signal-cli

```bash
brew install signal-cli
```

Or download manually from the [signal-cli releases page](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/releases).

Requires Java 21+ (Homebrew handles this automatically).

### Register a Phone Number

You can register any phone number you own. Numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+14155551234`).

#### Landline Registration (voice verification)

Signal requires an SMS attempt before allowing voice verification. For a landline, the SMS won't arrive — that's expected.

```bash
# Step 1: Solve the captcha
#   Go to https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html
#   Solve the captcha, then RIGHT-CLICK "Open Signal" and copy the link.
#   The link starts with signalcaptcha://

# Step 2: Request SMS verification with the captcha token (SMS won't arrive on landline — that's OK)
signal-cli -u +1YOURPHONENUMBER register --captcha "signalcaptcha://YOUR-CAPTCHA-TOKEN"

# Step 3: Wait at least 60 seconds for the SMS attempt to expire

# Step 4: Request voice verification (this will call your landline)
signal-cli -u +1YOURPHONENUMBER register --voice

# Step 5: Answer the call, note the 6-digit code, then verify
signal-cli -u +1YOURPHONENUMBER verify 123456
```

**Troubleshooting landline registration:**
- Steps 2 and 4 must be **separate commands**. Do NOT pass `--voice` and `--captcha` together — it will fail with `InvalidTransportModeException`.
- If step 4 fails with "Before requesting voice verification you need to request SMS verification and wait a minute", the SMS attempt (step 2) didn't register properly. Get a fresh captcha token and redo step 2 — tokens expire quickly.
- The voice call may have a **3-5 second silence** before the code is spoken. Use speakerphone and listen carefully. If no code is read, hang up and re-run step 4 to get a new call.
- If the voice call consistently has no audio, try a mobile number instead (see below).

#### Mobile Registration (SMS verification)

```bash
# Step 1: Solve captcha (same URL as above), then register
signal-cli -u +1YOURMOBILENUMBER register --captcha "signalcaptcha://YOUR-CAPTCHA-TOKEN"

# Step 2: Wait for SMS with code, then verify
signal-cli -u +1YOURMOBILENUMBER verify 123456
```

### Set Profile Name

After registration, set a display name so the recipient knows who's messaging:

```bash
signal-cli -u +1YOURPHONENUMBER updateProfile --given-name "Brave Core" --family-name "Bot"
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.envrc`:

```bash
export SIGNAL_SENDER="+14155551234"      # Your registered signal-cli number
export SIGNAL_RECIPIENT="+14155559876"   # Number to receive notifications
```

Then reload: `direnv allow`

### Test It

```bash
./scripts/signal-notify.sh "Hello from brave-bot!"
```

You should receive the message on the recipient's Signal account.

### What Gets Notified

| Event | Example Message |
|-------|----------------|
| PR created | `PR created: #12345 - Fix auth test https://...` |
| PR merged | `PR merged: #12345 - Fix auth test https://...` |
| Review feedback addressed | `Review addressed: PR #12345 - removed unnecessary thread hop` |
| PR review comments posted | `Review complete: 5 PRs reviewed, 2 with violations, 4 comments posted` |
| CI jobs retriggered | `CI retriggered: PR #12345 - 3 jobs restarted (2 normal, 1 WIPE_WORKSPACE)` |
| Learnable patterns found | `Learnable patterns: analyzed 10 PRs, found 3 patterns, updated coding-standards.md` |
| Best practice PR created | `Best practice PR created: https://... - Adjust RunUntilIdle rule` |

### Graceful Degradation

The notification script (`scripts/signal-notify.sh`) silently does nothing if:
- `SIGNAL_SENDER` or `SIGNAL_RECIPIENT` env vars are not set
- `signal-cli` is not installed
- The message send fails for any reason

No skill or workflow will error due to missing Signal configuration.

## Archiving

When the branch changes between runs, previous state is automatically archived:

```
archive/
  └── 2026-01-30-old-branch/
      ├── data/prd.json
      └── data/progress.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Git user not configured"

Run `make setup` again or manually configure git in your target repo with the username/email from `config.json`.

### "Pre-commit hook blocks my commit"

If the bot account is trying to modify dependencies — this is intentional. Use existing libraries or a different git account.

### "Org members cache missing"

Run `make setup` to regenerate `.ignore/org-members.txt`, or manually:
```bash
gh api /orgs/<your-org>/members --paginate --jq '.[].login' > .ignore/org-members.txt
```

### "Tests are taking too long"

Expected. The bot uses `run_in_background: true` and high timeouts (1-2 hours) for long operations.

### "Build failures after sync"

The bot will automatically rebase and re-sync:
```bash
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
npm run sync -- --no-history
```
